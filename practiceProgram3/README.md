# Basic Calculator for Analytical and Numerical Equations; and Absolute Relative Error
## Issue:
It currently does not work for step sizes that have decimal points besides '0.5'. The calculator only works for whole numbers.
## Made by Keoj :)

Needs to be ran in Java(if it is not already apparent) and you can tweak it to your liking.
Message me if there are any bugs, issues, etc.
Thank you! :D
